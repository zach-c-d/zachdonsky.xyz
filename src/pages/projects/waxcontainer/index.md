On summer afternoon in 2018, a few friends and I were joking around about the soon to be boom in the marijuana market. Cannibis was going to be legalized for recreational use in the fall, so we figured there would be an increased demand for business that supported the cannibis market.

One of the ideas that we toyed with was consumer dab containers. *'Dabs'* are a form of concentrated THC. Because they're so sticky, they need to be stored in a non-stick material, like silicone.

Seeing this as an opportunity to learn about casting silicone, maybe try our hands at some injection molding, and also design something neat, we took to the drawing board!

It was a short project. From research to the prototype it only took about 12 hours.

I had a great time playing with the ESP8266, making them into a simple web server and client.
