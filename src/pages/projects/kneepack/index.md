Back in 2016 I put out a message on the a facebook arthritis group. The message explained that I was an industrial design student, and that I'd be willing to help design and prototype any idea anyone had, so long as they messaged me and were willing to meetup.

A couple weeks after posting the message I got a response from a lady who explained her idea for a wheelchair knapsack. She called it a _kneepack_.

Sewing is difficult, but facinating and inspiring. Work on this project inspired me to start repairing my own soft products, like a patch I applied my backpack! I look forward to when I'm able to return to this concept with my new sewing skills.
