Back in 2016 I put out a message on the a facebook arthritis group. The message explained that I was an industrial design student, and that I'd be willing to help design and prototype any idea anyone had, so long as they messaged me and were willing to meetup.

A couple weeks after posting the message I got a response from a lady who explained her idea for a wheelchair knapsack. She called it a *kneepack*.

Soon after I met up with her and her husband at OCAD. We spent the afternoon spitballing ideas and building quick prototypes.

The project was intended to be build for my core industrial design class; I only had month or so to complete it.
