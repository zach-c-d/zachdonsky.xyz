Back in 2016 I put out a message on the a facebook arthritis group. The message explained that I was an industrial design student, and that I'd be willing to help design and prototype any idea anyone had, so long as they messaged me and were willing to meetup.

A couple weeks after posting the message I got a response from a lady who explained her idea for a wheelchair knapsack. She called it a *kneepack*.

Soon after I was able to meet up with her and her husband at OCAD. We spent the afternoon spitballing ideas and building quick prototypes.

The physical prototype was a bit of a mess. It was my first attempt at building a soft product.
