Back in 2016 I put out a message on the a facebook arthritis group. The message explained that I was an industrial design student, and that I'd be willing to help design and prototype any idea anyone had, so long as they messaged me and were willing to meetup.

A couple weeks after posting the message I got a response from a lady who explained her idea for a wheelchair knapsack. She called it a _kneepack_.
