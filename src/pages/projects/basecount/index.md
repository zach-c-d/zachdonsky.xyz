There was a digital occupancy management software that shelters had to track and publish this data, but it was too clunky to update it live. Most shelters updated it just once per night, just to record whether they had hit capacity or not.

So our team started development of a mobile friendly webapp where shelter staff could log in to their shelter's account and publish what their live capacity was.

My contribution to the project was to help with shelter interviews. At the time this project was getting started I was in the thick of running [Chalmers Cards](/chalmerscards), producing 20-40 booklets per week. Since I already had relationships with staff at some of the shelters I was able to lend some expertise in the early stages of the project and

I also created this neat single page site for the project: https://basecount.netlify.app/
