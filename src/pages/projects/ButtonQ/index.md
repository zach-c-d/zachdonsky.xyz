The ButtonQ was a project I built while I was working at TechTAP Inc. It was a product designed to help load balance cashier checkout queues at larger businesses.

ButtonQ is a screen that showed advertisements to customers waiting in line to checkout. Whenever a checkout aisle was available the screen would flash the number of the available checkout aisle.

TechTAP sold the system to a supplier of grocery store lighting solutions down in Nashville.

I got involved with the project from someone emailing the hacklab mailing board. They were looking for a way to toggle power on a light that ran on mains power. I responded back, keen to cut my teeth on my very first electronics contract job! It also seemed the perfect opportunity to test out the ESP8266, a WiFi capable microcontroller I had heard about at hacklab but never used myself.

Over a weekend myself and a TechTAP employee ( @exluto ) put together a proof of concept of the ButtonQ at Hacklab.TO!

After building the proof of concept TechTAP hired me on fulltime to complete the project.

We were under high time constraints. I had 2 months from getting hired to put together a prototype to ship to the client. They wanted 8 buttons that could turn mains power on/off and trigger a notice on a digital signage screen.

We used off the shelf parts for the buttons and mains power relay.
